-post and delete seem not to be working properly (try max boxy size 1)- doneezo prolly
-check for leaks
-double listen works
-maybe make root needed as well? what do we do if it's missing? are we hardcoding ./www ?

-execute response should be cleaned a bit.
-error handling should also be checked
-multiple listen ports in one server block maybe
