-post and delete seem not to be working properly (try max boxy size 1)- doneezo prolly
-autoindexing
-stress test the server (apparently checked on eval sheet)
-check for leaks
-remove illigal stuff that are not allowed by the subject.

-double listen works
-if cgi doesnt have execute permission we should give 403 forbidden. should we do that?
-maybe make root needed as well? what do we do if it's missing? are we hardcoding ./www ?
-check with error codes (500 and 403 for example) it says it twice.
-I still have double error code for /images
